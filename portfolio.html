<h3> About Me:</h3>

    My name is Christian, I am 25 years old and I am training to be a Junior Software Developer.
    <br>
    I am currently on a 12 week bootcamp course with Code Nation to gain new knowledge on coding languages.
    <br> 
    I enjoy creating new and exciting things from scratch and seeing them through to completion adding to my portfolio.

I like to use my creativity and outside of the box mindset in order to discover new opportunities and make something new and exciting.
